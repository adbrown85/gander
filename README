Gander
======

Gander is a lightweight scene renderer for testing and visualizing GLSL
shaders.  Tying together OpenGL objects and GLSL shaders using traditional code
can be tedious and error-prone.  Gander makes the process much easier.

Most importantly, Gander features an intuitive XML scene graph that takes care
of the low-level details in creating OpenGL scenes, allowing the user to focus
on writing the shaders themselves.

In addition, Gander supports several advanced features that can help
facilitate more specialized scenes, such as those that need multiple rendering
passes for example.

Gander is written in C++ using GLFW and should work on both Mac OS X and
Linux.

To install Gander, see the INSTALL document.  For a rundown on the changes
between versions, see the NEWS document.  Lastly, if you want to experiment
with the code or contribute new features or fixes, please see the HACKING
document.
