To install Gander from a distribution, first make sure you have the necessary
tools and dependencies installed.  You will need g++, GNU Make, GLFW,
Poco Foundation, M3d, Gloop, Glycerin, and RapidGL.  Windows users will need
to install a Bourne-compatible shell, like the one provided with MinGW.

Then extract the archive and execute the following three commands:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS X may need to provide
administrator privileges to install Gander in the default directory.  On Mac
OS X and Ubuntu, precede the install command with 'sudo' as shown below.

    sudo make install

The installation directory that Gander is installed into can be modified by
specifying the 'prefix' option to the configure script.

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME

Gander can be uninstalled by running the command below.

    make uninstall
